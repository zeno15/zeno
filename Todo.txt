TODO

Change from platform conditional includes (InputImpl) to typedefs (WindowImpl)

Remove glew/opengl from zeno lib, instead have swapBuffer() etc for display

Look at http://visualgdb.com/tutorials/linux/ for developing on windows for linux

AdjustWindowRect to have windows be the actual size. not including the frame
-	Also check/modify all the window get/set size functions

Set v-sync etc or desired fps

LShift doesnt work

Implement window styles

change all Deconstructor to Destructor

use find_required in cmake for glew, opengl, freetype etc

have shared libraries be created as well
	-	Test that all 4 library versions work on both platforms

look into if a abstract base class "Drawable" etc is a good thing
	-	For vertex array, sprite implement drawable


Implement doxygen into header files

implement sleep function

add passing uniforms into vertex arrays	-	similar to sfml renderstates

opengl contexts when using different windows

have shaders work with multiple textures for vertex array?
have shader for when a texture is/isnt used with vertex array

2d transformable
3d transformable

have RenderData take in a shader name, and then a drawable sub class with overloaded window render method of (const zeno::Drawable& _drawable, zeno::RenderData _renderData)

Fonts
	-	handle different font sizes within the same font object
	-	need to make sure there is a single non available glyph that is used for all characters that need it
	-	Font::createCharVertexes uses the texture size when it may be modified
	-	currently passing colour data into the gpu, then passing colour uniform, wasteful.

find better way to update textures than completely recreating them (i.e. as in font) Pixel Buffer Objects

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE

textures 
vertexes
vertex arrays
sprites

add sub directories for gui code, window code, graphics, networking, audio, system
add different libraries for each sub directory
Change all #ifndef INCLUDED_FILENAME_EXTENSION's to something with the project name etc in it

Fonts
	-	move font stuff to graphics
	-	2d orthographic text
	-	have unique shader for text, needs to take as a uniform the texture size, or figure out a way to use pixel coords instead of 0.0f->1.0
